QUESTION ANSWER IS BELOW:

Do you converted rbxl file to brk file?
-No. I didn't but  i planning coding something like that

Is theres lag?
Sometimes little lag can happen but it can't ruin your fun its really unnoticable. Also if you are experincing lag please contact with your internet service provider i can't do anything about that if you are only experincing lag.

Map is too small, why?

Beacuse i was trying much as accurate but sometimes it will be hard and i can't do fully map.

People with lag problems close webpages and other applications using internet.

Also be sure your internet speed is higher than 3mbps.

Thanks for supporting.!!!
